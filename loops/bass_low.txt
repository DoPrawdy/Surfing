An old bass guitar in a surf rental shop
The bass guitar was used along with other instruments as decoration in the shop. I'm grateful to the owners who agreed that I could drop by after surfing to record some music. When I finished recording the drums, it was already late and they were about to close soon, so I had just a few minutes to record the bass. I connected it directly to the line of the BOSS RC-505 Loop Station. Because of the limited time I only had a few takes, that's why there is an unexpected gap in the loop.
