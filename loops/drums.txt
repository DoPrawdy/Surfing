A drumset in a surf rental shop
The drumset was used along with other instruments as decoration in the shop. I'm grateful to the owners who agreed that I could drop by after surfing to record some music. I used the T.bone SC300 budget microphone connected to the line of the BOSS RC-505 Loop Station.
