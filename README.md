"Surfing" is a cover of a song by the band Myslovitz, called "Å»ycie to surfing", which means "Life is a surfing".

Most of the song was recorded while living in a van and surfing in Portugal.

The assumption was not to record cover songs. Although some ideas for original songs were appearing at that time, none of them would motivate me to record them.

What motivated me instead, was singing together with a local surfer, Pedro. The idea was to record a Polish song with his vocals. In these circumstances, with it's meaningful words and mesmerising feel, "Life is a surfing" was an obvious choice. To convince Pedro and motivate him to learn the Polish words, I decided to record as much music as I could in a short time.

I had a guitar and small MIDI Keyboard in the van, but I couldn't travel around with drums and bass. When I bumped upon a drum kit and a bunch of old instruments used as decoration in a surf shop, I knew that the song has to be recorded. 

Unfortunately because of some other waves, the vocals part didn't work out (yet?).

After getting back home, I realised the truth: that the only recorded material from the trip was this cover. Because truth is the ultimate goal of this project, I understood that the cover song has to be finished, so I added some missing parts and vocals and mixed it. I would have given up, but Andrzej convinced me that the song has a good vibe. Hopefully it's not the end and there will be a contribution on LooperHub with proper vocals.
